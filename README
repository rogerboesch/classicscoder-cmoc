Home page: http://sarrazip.com/dev/cmoc.html

License

    See the file COPYING. Note that it does not apply to the files
    under src/usim-0.91-cmoc.

Installation

    See the file INSTALL. CMOC requires LWTOOLS and works under a
    Unix-like operating system. See the home page for details.

Automake

    To do CMOC development, GNU Automake 1.12 or later is required
    (previous versions generate src/parser.h instead of src/parser.hh).

Documentation

    See doc/cmoc-manual.markdown. If the `markdown' preprocessor is
    installed, then after running the configure script, `make html'
    in the top source directory will generate doc/cmoc-manual.html,
    which will include a table of contents.

    A description of the implementation is also available in
    doc/cmoc-implementation.markdown.
